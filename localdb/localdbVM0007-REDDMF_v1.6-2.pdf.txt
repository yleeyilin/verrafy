Additionality and Crediting Method 
Additionality WRC projects in ti dal wetlands: Activity method 
All other project activ ities: Project Method 
Crediting Baseline Project Method 
This REDD+ Methodology Framework d ocument is the basic structur e of a modular REDD+ 
methodology. It provides the generic  functionality of the metho dology, which frames pre-defined 
modules and tools that perform a  specific func tion. It constitu tes, together with the modules and 
tools it calls upon, a complete REDD+ baseline and monitoring m ethodology. 
The modules and tools called upon in this document are applicab le to:  
 Project activities that reduce emissions from planned (APD) an d unplanned (AUDD) 
deforestation 
 Activities that reduce emiss ions from forest degradation 
 Afforestation, reforestation and revegetation activities (ARR)  
 Project activities that reduce emissions from planned (APWD) a nd unplanned (AUWD) 
wetland degradation 
 Wetland restoration activities (RWE)  
or combinations of these. Hereafter in this methodology and all other modules related to this methodology applied to 
avoiding planned deforestation projects, where the term “planne d deforestation” is used, it refers 
to both planned deforestati on and planned degradation. 
The reference to this methodology and the modules used to const ruct the project-specific 
methodology must be given in the project description (PD).

REDD+MF - 7 Identification of the Most Plaus ible VCS-eligible Activity(ies)  
To identify the type of VCS-eligib le project activity, use the decision trees in Tables 1 to 3 below. 
The decision trees must be used to provide a broad indication o f likely baseline type and 
applicability. Ultimately, the relevant baseline modules ( BL-UP  – avoiding unplanned 
deforestation or wetland degradation; BL-PL  – avoiding planned deforestation, planned 
degradation, or planned wetland degradation; BL-DFW  – avoiding forest degradation 
(fuelwood/charcoal); BL-ARR  - land suited for ARR; BL-PEAT  – peatland and BL-TW  – tidal 
wetland) must be applied with relevant applicability conditions  and criteria. 
Provide all the necessary evidence to demonstrate the type of e ligible activity as given in each 
module.  
A project can include areas subj ect to differen t eligible activ ities (e.g., Area A = avoiding planned 
deforestation; Area B = avoidi ng unplanned deforestation; Area C = avoiding degradation; Area D 
= reforestation; Area E = peatla nd rewetting and reforestation;  Area F = tidal wetland restoration 
and reforestation). In such cases  the areas that are eligible f or different categories must be 
captured by different strata and clearly delineated (i.e., with out spatial overlap), and the 
procedures outlined bel ow applied to each of them separately. P rojects may be stand-alone 
REDD, ARR and/or WRC. Projects may  combine WRC with REDD, or WR C with ARR, in a single 
area, in which case they must appl y concomitantly the procedure s for both categories provided in 
this methodology, unless, in the case of stand-alone REDD or AR R on wetlands, the expected 
emissions from the soil organic carbon pool or change in the so il organic carbon pool in the 
project scenario is deemed de minimis , or, in the case of stand- alone RWE with presence of 
vegetation, the expected emissi ons from the biomass pool or cha nge in the biomass pool in 
the project scenario is deemed de minimis . The tool T-SIG  must be used to justify the omission 
of carbon pools and emission sources. 
The demonstration of eligibility must be reported in the PD. 
Tables 1 and 2 below provide a decision tree for identifying th e types of REDD and ARR project 
activities eligible under this methodology.

If the project area includes  peatland already drained6, or tidal wetlands already degraded7 or that 
would be drained or d egraded in the baselin e case, the project must combine the project activities 
identified above with the WRC ca tegory, as set out in Table 3 b elow.

4  If the answer is “yes”, evidence must be provided based on th e application of Module BL-PL . Projects are required 
to show legal permissibility to  deforest, suitability of projec t area for conversion and intent to deforest. 
5  If degradation is occurring through legal or sanctioned timbe r production this is an eligible IFM activity.

3 DEFINITIONS 
In addition to the definitions se t out in the VCS Program docum ent Program Definitions , the 
following definitions apply to this methodology: 
Baseline Period   
The period of time with a fixed baseline (10 years), applicable  to REDD and WRC baselines VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 12 Degraded Wetland  
A wetland which has be en altered by human or natural impact thr ough the impairment of physical, 
chemical and/or biological properties, and in which the alterat ion has resulted in a reduction of the 
diversity of wetland-associated species, soil carbon and/or the  complexity of other ecosystem 
functions which previously existed in the wetland. 
Expert Judgment   
Judgment on methodological choice and choice of input data and to fill gaps in the available data, 
to select data from a range of possible values or on uncertaint y ranges as established in the 
IPCC 2006 Good Practice Guidance . Obtaining well-informed judgments from domain experts 
regarding best estimates and un certainties of inputs to the qua ntification of emission reductions is 
an important aspect in various procedures throughout this metho dology. The guidance provided 
in Chapter 2, Volume 1 (Approac hes to Data Collection) must be used, in particular, Section 2.2 
and Annex 2A.1 of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories . 
Historical Reference Period  
The historical period prior to t he project start date that serv es as the source of data for defining 
the baseline. 
Organic Soil 
Soil with a surface layer of mat erial that has a sufficient dep th and percentage of organic carbon 
to meet thresholds set by the IP CC (Wetlands supplement) for or ganic soil. Where used in this 
methodology, the term peat is used  to refer to organic soil. 
Terrestrial 
On land, in the context of this  methodology, though not on a we tland. 
Tidal Wetland 
A subset of wetland s under the influence of the wetting and dry ing cycles of the tides (e.g., 
marshes, seagrass mea dows, tidal forested we tlands and mangrove s). Sub-tidal seagrass 
meadows are not subject to drying cycles, but are still include d in this definition. 
Tidal Wetland Restoration  
Reestablishing or improving the hydrology, salinity, water qual ity, sediment supply and/or 
vegetation in degraded or convert ed tidal wetlands. For the pur pose of this methodology, this 
definition also includes activities that create wetland ecologi cal conditions on uplands under the 
influence of sea level rise or ac tivities that convert one wetl and type to another or activities that 
convert open water to wetland.

4 APPLICABILITY CONDITIONS 
4.1 General 
This REDD+ Methodology Framework is a compilation of modules an d tools that together define 
the project activity and necessary  methodological steps. By cho osing the appropriate modules, a 
project-specific methodology can be constructed. The justificat ion of the choice of modules and 
why they are applicable to the pr oposed project activity must b e given in the PD. 
Specific applicability conditions  exist for each module and mus t be met for the module to be used. 
This methodology includes unplanned forest degradation caused o nly by extraction of wood for 
fuel. No modules are included for activities to reduce emission s from forest degradation caused 
by illegal harvesting of trees for timber.9  
Use of this methodology is subj ect to the followi ng applicabili ty conditions, noting the project must 
also comply with the applicabilit y conditions of the applied mo dules and tools. 
4.2 All Project Activities 
All land areas registered under t he CDM or under any other GHG program (both voluntary and 
compliance-oriented) must be tr ansparently reported and exclude d from the project area. The 
exclusion of land in the project a rea from any other GHG progra m must be monitored over time 
and reported in the monitoring reports. 
                                                            
9  Illegal timber harvest may be occurring in the project area i n the baseline but conservatively no benefit can be 
calculated for preventing timber harvests, and any  emissions ar ising from timber harvests in the project case must 
be monitored and deducted from c alculated project net emission reductions. VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 14 4.3 REDD 
4.3.1 All REDD Activity Types 
REDD activity types are applicabl e under the following conditio ns: 
 Land in the project area has qualified as forest (following th e definition used by VCS; in 
addition, see Section 5.1.2) for at least the 10 years prior to  the project start date. 
Mangrove forests are excluded from any tree height requirement in a forest definition, as 
they consist of (close to) 100%  mangrove species, which often d o not reach the same 
height as other tree species, and occupy contiguous areas and t heir functioning as a 
forest is independent of tree height. 
 If land within the project area is peatland or tidal wetlands and emissions from the SOC 
pool are deemed significant, the relevant WRC modules (see Tabl e 3) must be applied 
alongside other relevant modules. 
 Baseline deforestation and forest degradation in the project a rea fall within one or 
more of the following categories: 
 Unplanned deforestation (VCS category AUDD) 
 Planned deforestation/degradation (VCS category APD) 
 Degradation through extraction of wood for fuel (fuelwood and charcoal 
production) (VCS category AUDD) 
 Leakage avoidance activities must not include: 
 Agricultural lands that are flooded to increase production (e. g., rice paddy) 
 Intensifying livestock produc tion through use of feed-lots10 and/or manure 
lagoons.11 
4.3.2 Avoiding Unplanned Deforestation 
Avoiding unplanned deforestation activities are applicable unde r the following conditions: 
 Baseline agents of deforestati on must: (i) clear the land for tree harvesting, settlements, 
crop production (agriculturalis t) or ranching or  aquaculture, w here such clearing for crop 
production or ranching or aqua culture does not amount to large scale industrial 
agriculture or aquaculture activities12; (ii) have no documented and uncontested legal 
right to deforest the land for t hese purposes; and (iii) be eit her residents in the reference 
region for deforestation (cf. Section 5.1.2 below) or immigrant s. Under any other 
condition this methodology must not be used. 
                                                            
10 Feedlots are defined as areas in which naturally grazing anima ls are confined to an area which produces no feed 
and are fed on stored feeds. 
11 Anaerobic lagoons that function as receptacles for animal wast e flushed from animal pens. Anaerobic organisms 
present in the manure and the environment decompose the waste i n the lagoon. 
12 Small-scale / large-scale agricult ure or aquaculture is to be defined and justifi ed by the project. VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 15  If, in the baseline scenario o f avoiding unplanned deforestati on project activities, post-
deforestation land use constitu tes reforestation, this methodol ogy may not be used 
4.3.3 Avoiding Planned De forestation/Degradation 
Avoiding planned deforestation/degr adation activities are appli cable under the following condition: 
 Where conversion of forest lands to  a deforested condition mus t be legally permitted. 
4.3.4 Avoiding Forest Degradation (Fuelwood/Charcoal) 
Avoiding forest degradation activities are applicable under the  following conditions: 
 Fuelwood collection and charcoal  production must be non-renewa ble13 in the baseline 
period. 
 If degradation is caused by eit her illegal or legal tree extra ction for timber, this 
methodology cannot be used. 
4.4 ARR 
ARR activities are applicable under the following conditions: 
 The project area is non-forest land or land with degraded fore st.14 
 In strata with drained15 organic soil, ARR activities must be combined with rewetting. 
ARR activities are not eligible  under the following conditions:  
 The project scenario involves t he application of nitrogen fert ilizers. 
 If ARR activities enhance pea t oxidation. Therefore, on peatla nd, the project must include 
at least some degree o f rewetting. In a tidal  system where the tidal regime is restored or 
continues to be in place, ARR ac tivities are considered not to enhance peat oxidation. 
Where project activities on wetl ands are excluded by the applic ability conditions of applied

4.5.1 All WRC Activity Types 
WRC activities are not eligible  under the following conditions:  
 Project activities lo wer the water table, unless the project c onverts open water to tidal 
wetlands, or improves the hydrological connection to impounded waters. 
 Changes in hydrology do not result in the accumulation or main tenance of SOC stock, 
noting that a) this pertains to  projects that intend to sequest er carbon through 
sedimentation and/or vegetation development and b) this does no t pertain to projects that 
increase salinity to reduce CH 4 emissions. Projects that aim to decrease CH 4 emissions 
through increased salinity must account for any changes in SOC stocks. 
 Hydrological connectivity of the project area with adjacent ar eas leads to a significant 
increase in GHG emissions outside the project area. 
 Project activities include  the burning of organic soil. 
 Nitrogen fertilizer(s), such as chemical fertilizer or manure,  are applied in the project area 
during the project crediting period. 
4.5.2 RWE Project Activities 
General 
For RWE project activities, pri or to the project start date, th e project area mus t meet the following 
conditions16: 
a) The area is free of any land us e that could be displaced out side the project area, as 
demonstrated by at least one of t he following, where relevant: 
 The project area has been abandoned for two or more years prio r to the project 
start date; or  
 Use of the project area for co mmercial purpo ses (i.e., trade) is not profitable as a 
result of salinity intrusion, m arket forces, or other factors. In addition, timber 
harvesting in the baseline scenari o within the project area doe s not occur; or  
 Degradation of additional wetlands for new agricultural/aquacu ltural sites within 
the country will not occur or is  prohibited by enforced law. 
OR 
b) The area is under a land use t hat could be displaced outside  the project area, although in 
such case, baseline emissions fr om this land use must not be ac counted for, and where

Peatland Rewetting 
This methodology is applicable to rewetting drained peatland (R DP) activities on project areas 
that meet the VCS definition for peatland (see VCS Program Definitions )17. 
Tidal Wetland Restoration 
Project activities restoring ti dal wetlands may include any of the following, or combinations of the 
following:  
 Creating, restoring and/or managi ng hydrological conditions (e .g., removing tidal barriers, 
improving hydrological connect ivity, restoring tidal flow to we tlands or lowering water 
levels on impounded wetlands)  
 Altering sediment supply (e.g ., beneficial use of dredge mater ial or diverting river 
sediments to sediment-starved areas)  
 Changing salinity characterist ics (e.g., restoring tidal flow to tidally-restricted areas)  
 Improving water quality (e.g., r educing nutrient loads leading  to improved water clarity to 
expand seagrass meadows, recoveri ng tidal and other hydrologic flushing and exchange 
or reducing nutrient residence time)  
 (Re-)introdu cing native plant communities (e.g., reseeding or replanting)  
 Improving management practice(s) (e.g., removing invasive spec ies, reduced grazing) 
 In RWE-ARR project activities , the prescribed burning of herba ceous and shrub 
aboveground biomass (cover burns) may occur 
4.5.3 CIW Project Activities 
This methodology is applicable to conservation of undrained and  partially drained peatland 
(CUPP) activities on project ar eas that meet the VCS definition  for peatland (see VCS Program 
Definitions ). 
                                                            
17 RDP and CUPP project activities are both subcategories of Resto ration of Wetland Ecosystems (RWE) and 
Conservation of Intact Wetlands (CIW) of the Wetlands Restorati on and Conservation (WRC) project category.  VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 18 Project activities conserving tidal wetlands may include: 
 Protecting at-risk wetlands ( e.g., establishing conservation e asements, establishing 
community supported management agr eements, establishing protect ive government 
regulations, and preventing disruption of water and/ or sedimen t supply to wetland areas) 
 Improving water management on drained wetlands 
 Maintaining or improving water quality for seagrass meadows  
 Recharging sediment to avoid d rowning of coastal wetlands 
 Creating accommodation space fo r wetlands migrating with sea-l evel rise 
Avoiding Unplanned Wetla nd Degradation (AUWD) 
Avoiding unplanned wetland degradation activities18 are eligible under the following condition: 
 Baseline agents of wetland degr adation (i) cause an alteration  in the hydrology of the 
project area (involving drainage , interrupted sediment supply, or both) and/or a loss of 
soil organic carbon; (ii) have no documented and uncontested le gal right to degrade the 
wetland; and (iii) are either residents in the reference region  for wetland degradation (see 
Section 5.1.4 below) or immigrants. Under any other condition, this methodology must 
not be used. 
Avoiding Planned Wetlan d Degradation (APWD) 
Avoiding planned wetland degradation activities19 are eligible under the following condition:

REDD+MF - 19 5.1 Geographical Boundaries 
5.1.1 General 
The spatial boundaries20 of a project must cl early be defined, so as to facilitate accu rate 
measuring, monitoring, accounting , and verifying of the project ’s emissions reductions and 
removals. The project activity may contain more than one discre te area of land. When describing 
physical project boundaries, the  following information must be provided per discrete area:  
 Name of the project area (e.g., compartment number, allotment number, local name); 
Unique ID for each discrete parcel of land 
 Map(s) of the area (preferably in digital format) 
 Geographic coordinates of each polygon vertex along with the d ocumentation of their 
accuracy (from a geo-referenced digital map – data must be prov ided in the format 
specified / required by the VCS) 
 Total land area; and  
 Details of landholder and user rights 
The geographical boundaries of a project are fixed ( ex ante ) and cannot change over the 
project lifetime ( ex post ). Where multiple baselines exist (e.g., planned deforestation,  unplanned 
deforestation, forest degradation, degraded land) there must be  no overlap in boundaries 
between areas appropriate to each of the baselines. Thus, two p roject types cannot occur on 
the same piece of land, other than those including a WRC compon ent (i.e., combined 
REDD+WRC, ARR+WRC). 
5.1.2 REDD  
The boundary of the REDD activity  must be clearly delineated an d defined and include only land 
qualifying as forest for a minimum of 10 years prior to the pro ject start date. Mangrove forests are 
excluded from any tree height requirement in a forest definitio n, as nearly 100% or all of their 
vegetation consists of mangrove species, which often do not rea ch the same height as other tree 
species, and they occupy conti guous areas. Eco logically, their functioning as a forest is 
independent of tree height. 
In REDD project activities, var ious kinds of boundaries must be  distinguished, depending on the 
REDD category (planned or unpla nned deforestati on, forest degra dation), i.e., in case of: 
 Avoiding planned deforestation: project area and proxy area(s) . Refer to Module BL-PL  
for the detailed procedures  to define these boundaries. 
 Avoiding unplanned deforestation : project area, reference regi ons for deforestation, and 
leakage belt area. Refer to Module BL-UP  for definitions and the detailed procedures to 
define these boundaries.

REDD+MF - 20  Avoiding forest degradation: Refer to Module BL-DFW  (for degradation due to removals 
for wood fuel or charcoal) for  the detailed procedures to defin e these boundaries.  
These procedures also apply to CIW  or combined REDD+CIW project  activities, see Section 
5.1.4.  
Methods for establishing the boun daries of areas subject to lea kage from activity shifting are 
provided in the following modules: 
 For avoiding planned deforestation/degradation: Module LK-ASP  
 For avoiding unplanned deforestation: Module BL-UP   
5.1.3 ARR  
The project area must not have been not cleared of native ecosy stems to create GHG 
emissions reductions/removals. Such proof is not required where  such clearing took place prior 
to the 10-year period prior to the project start date. Areas th at do not meet this requirement 
must be excluded from the project area. 
5.1.4 WRC  
The WRC project area must meet the definition as provided in th e VCS Standard : “The project 
area shall meet an internationally accepted definition of wetla nd, such as from the IPCC, 
Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, th ose established by law or nati onal policy, or those with 
broad agreement in the peer-revie wed scientific literature for specific countries or types of 
wetlands. Common wetland types in clude peatland, salt marsh, ti dal freshwater marsh, 
mangroves, wet fl oodplain forests,  prairie potholes and seagras s meadows.” 
For RWE project activities, the project area must not have been  drained or converted to create 
GHG emissions reductions/removal s. Such proof is not required w here such draining or 
conversion took place prior to 1  January 2008. Areas that do no t meet this requirement must be 
excluded from the project boundary. 
The maximum eligible quantity of GHG emission reductions in WRC  project activities is limited 
to the difference between the remaining SOC stock in the projec t and baseline scenarios after 
100 years. If a significant differe nce at the 100-years mark ca nnot be demonstrated, the project 
area is not eligible for carbon crediting. The assessment must be executed ex ante  using 
conservative parameters. Procedures are provided in Module X-STR . 
WRC project activities in ti dal zones must take account of effe cts of sea-level rise on project 
boundaries. Procedures are provided in Module X-STR . 
In CIW project activities that a re not combined with REDD activ ities, various types of boundaries 
must be distinguished, depending on the CIW category (i.e., pla nned or unplanned wetland 
degradation). For example, in the case of: VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 21  Avoiding planned wetland degradat ion (APWD), the project area and proxy area(s) must

boundaries. 
 Avoiding unplanned wetland degr adation (AUWD), the project are a, reference regions for 
wetland degradation, and leakage belt area must be defined. Ref er to Module BL-UP  for 
definitions and the detailed pr ocedures to define these boundar ies. 
5.2 Temporal Boundaries 
The following temporal boundaries must be specified: 
5.2.1 Start Date and End Date of the Historical Reference Perio d 
REDD 
The historical reference period is the temporal domain from whi ch information on historical 
deforestation is extracted, analyz ed and projected into the fut ure. A historical reference period 
must be defined for all eligible  REDD categories. The starting date of this period must be between 
9 and 12 years in the past and t he end date must be within two years before proje ct start date.  
WRC 
While developing WRC baselines, the project must reference a pe riod of at least 10 years in 
order to model a spatial trend in  drainage, and it must take in to account long-term (20-year) 
average climate variables, for which procedures are provided in  Modules BL-PEAT  and BL-TW . 
5.2.2 Start Date and End Date o f the Project Crediting Period 
General 
The project crediting period is  the period of time for which GH G emission reductions or removals 
generated by the project are eligible for crediting with the VC S Program. The project must have a 
robust operating plan covering this period.  
The project crediting period for AFOLU projects must be between  20 and 100 years. The duration 
of the project activity/crediti ng period must be reported in th e PD.  
REDD 
Projections of baseline emission s must be presented in the PD f or the first 10-year period after 
the project starting date. Emissi on reductions/removals can onl y be claimed for 10-year periods, 
for which the baseline is fixed and a monitoring plan has been implemented. 
  VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 22 WRC 
Projections of baseline emission s from wetlands must be present ed in the PD for the first 10-year 
period after the start of the proj ect. Emission reductions/remo vals can only be claimed for 10-year 
periods for which the baseline is  fixed and a monitoring plan h as been implemented. 
Peat Depletion Time (PDT) and So il organic carbon Depletion Tim e (SDT) 
The PDT or SDT for a stratum in  the baseline scenario equals th e period during which the project 
can claim emission reductions from rewetting, restoration or co nservation. Procedures for 
determining the PDT or SDT are provided in Module X-STR . 
Peat depletion may be accelerate d by peat fires and is attained  if the peat has disappeared or if a 
stable water table inhibits fu rther oxidation of the peat. 
Since the PDT and SDT are part o f the baseline assessment, they  must be reassessed every 10 
years. 
5.2.3 Duration of the Monitoring Periods 
The minimum duration of a monitoring period is one year and the  maximum duration is 10 years.  
Baseline projections must be ann ual and be available for each p roposed future verification date. 
Data on baseline deforestation and degradation rates, as well a s on the hydrological layout and 
climatic variables in wetland areas, must be presented, as well  as data collected for future 
baseline revision. 
5.3 Carbon Pools 
5.3.1 General 
Any significant decreases in ca rbon stock in the project scenar io and any significant increases in 
carbon stock in the bas eline scenario must be accounted for. In  addition, decreases in the 
baseline scenario and increases  in the project scenario can be accounted for. Where ARR or 
REDD activities take p lace on wetlands, the project must accoun t for expected emissions from 
the soil organic carbon pool or  change in the soil organic carb on pool in the project scenario, 
unless they are deemed de minimis . The significance of this pool  may be determined by using the 
tool T-SIG . 
Selection of carbon pools and t he appropriate justification mus t be presented in PD. 
5.3.2 REDD  
The carbon pools (and corresp onding methodology modules) includ ed in or excluded from the 
boundary of REDD project activities are shown in Table 4.  VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 23 Harvested wood products and dea d wood must be included when the y increase more or 
decrease less in the baseline t han in the project scenario. In all other cases, only aboveground 
biomass is mandatory. If a carbon p ool is included in the basel ine accounting, it must also be 
included in project scenario and leakage accounting.  
Where the carbon pool in harves ted wood products and dead wood increases more or decreases 
less in the baseline case than in the project case, the tool T-SIG must be used to determine 
whether significant. Insignific ant pools can always be ignored.

5.4 Sources of GHG Emissions  
5.4.1 General 
The project must account for any significant increases in emiss ions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), 
nitrous oxide (N 2O) and methane (CH 4) relative to the baseline that are reasonably attributable to 
the project activity, with additional guidance provided in Tabl es 6, 7 and 8.  
T-SIG  may be used to determine whether  an emissions source is signif icant. If a source is 
included in the estimation of baseline emissions22, it must also be included in the calculation of 
project and leakage emissions.

REDD+MF - 28 6 BASELINE SCENARIO 
6.1 Determination of the Most Plausible Baseline Scenario 
For each of the included project a ctivities, the most plausible  baseline scenario must be 
determined using T-ADD , listed in Section 2 above. The  tool has been designed for A/R  CDM 
project activities, but is used for this methodology by applyin g the notes provided for Table 10, 
below. 
Table 10: Translation between VCS and CDM Terminology  
Where the tool refers to:  It must be understood as referring to: 
A/R, afforestation, reforestati on, or forestation REDD, ARR or WRC project activity 
Net greenhouse gas removals by sinks Net greenhouse gas emissio n reductions 
CDM VCS 
DOE VVB 
tCERs, lCERs VCUs 
Footnotes 1 and 3 included in T-ADD  can be disregarded. In case t here is a conflict between the 
CDM tool requirements and the VCS rules, the VCS rules must be followed (as set out in VCS 
AFOLU Guidance:  Additional guidance for VCS Afforestat ion, Reforestation and Revegetation 
projects using CDM Afforestation/Reforestation Methodologies , available on the VCS website). 
Where project proponents use avai lable data sourced from a juri sdictional baseline that meets the 
requirements set out in the VCS JNR Requirements , those data sources may be used under this 
methodology, where conservative, e ven where data accuracy may b e less stringent than required 
by this methodology. 
 
6.2 Re-assessing the Baseline Scenario 
The project baseline must be re vised at the following frequenci es: 
 For planned deforestation projects, the baseline must be revis ed every 10 years for 
ongoing planned deforestation.  
 For unplanned deforestation, the project baseline must be revi sed every 10 years from 
the project start date.  
 For degradation, the baseline mu st be revised every 10 years. 
 For WRC areas, the project mus t, for the duration of the proje ct, reassess the baseline 
every 10 years and have this va lidated at the same time as the subsequent verification. VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 29 The date of the next scheduled re vision must be specified. The starting point for the baseline 
revision of the project will be t he forest cover projected to e xist at the end of the baseline period. 
Projections for each baseline revision will be subject to indep endent verification. 
Reassessments must capture chan ges in the drivers and/or behavi or of agents that cause the 
change in land use and/or land management practices and changes  in carbon stocks. The new 
baseline scenario must be incorpor ated into revised estimates o f baseline emissions. This 
baseline reassessment must include the evaluation of the validi ty of proxies for GHG emissions. 
For REDD and WRC pro ject activities, ex-ante  baseline projections bey ond a 10-year period are 
not required. For this a ssessment, the histor ic reference perio d is extended to include the original 
reference period and all subsequent monitoring periods up to th e beginning of the current 
monitoring period. 
7 ADDITIONALITY 
7.1 Project method – all project activities other than tidal we tland conservation and

8 QUANTIFICATION OF GHG EMISSI ON REDUCTIONS AND REMOVALS 
8.1 Baseline Emissions 
8.1.1 General 
Each activity type included in  the project must estimate an ind ividual baseline following the 
provisions and specific modules mentioned below. Combined activ ities (i.e., ARR or REDD with a 
WRC component) must develop a uni que baseline considering peat or tidal wetland soils as the VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 30 SOC pool and incorporating the re sulting emission estimates to the calculation of emissions and 
carbon stock change s of the ARR and/or  REDD activities. 
The same procedure must be followed ex ante  and ex post . For parameters that will be monitored 
subsequent to project initiation , guidance is given in the para meter tables of the relevant modules 
for the values that must be used in ex-ante  calculations. 
8.1.2 REDD 
The baseline of the REDD proj ect activity is estimated ex ante . It can be monitored in a reference 
area (unplanned deforestation) or proxy area (planned deforesta tion) for the purpose of 
periodically adjusting the baseline. Ex-ante  baseline estimations are  therefore used in both the 
ex-ante  and ex-post  estimation of net carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emis sion 
reductions. 
Methods for estimating net base line carbon stock changes and gr eenhouse gas emissions are 
provided in the following modules: 
 For planned deforestation/degradation: Module BL-PL    
 For unplanned deforestation: Module BL-UP    
 For forest degradation from e xtraction of wood for fuel: Modul e BL-DFW  
8.1.3 ARR 
The net GHG removals in the baseline scenario must be estimated  using Module BL-ARR . 
8.1.4 WRC 
Baseline net emissions from the SOC pool must be estimated usin g Module BL-PEAT  or BL-TW , 
whichever is relevant (see Table 3). For peat strata within tid al wetlands, Module BL-PEAT  must 
be used. 
Socio-economic processes causing the degradation of wetlands ar e similar to those causing 
deforestation or forest degradat ion. Therefore, for stand-alone  CIW project activities (e.g., 
conservation of salt marshes without a tree biomass component),  similar methods for baseline 
determination can be used as for REDD project activities. Stand -alone CIW as well as CIW-
REDD project activities use Module BL-TW  or BL-PEAT  (whichever is relevant) in conjunction 
with Module BL-UP  or BL-PL  (whichever is relevant). 
Stand-alone RWE and RWE-ARR project activities must use Module BL-PEAT  or BL-TW  
(whichever is relevant) for baseline net GHG emissions from the  SOC pool. In case fossil fuel 
combustion is accounted for, Module E-FFC  must be used as well. RWE-ARR project activities 
must also use Module BL-ARR  for the accounting of biomass and biomass burning (if relevant ). 
RWE-REDD project activities must use Module BL-PEAT  or BL-TW  for the estimation of 
baseline net GHG emissions from the SOC pool, and Module BL-UP  or BL-PL  for all other pools 
and emissions. VM0007, Version 1.6

REDD+MF - 31 8.2 Project Emissions 
8.2.1 General 
The same procedure must be followed ex ante  and ex post . For parameters that will be monitored 
subsequent to project initiation , guidance is given in the para meter tables of the relevant modules 
for the values that must be used in ex-ante  calculations. 
8.2.2 REDD 
Methods for estimating net carbon stock changes and GHG emissio ns in the project scenario are 
provided in Module M-REDD . 
8.2.3 ARR 
The net GHG removals in the proj ect scenario must be estimated using Module M-ARR . 
8.2.4 WRC 
Net GHG emissions from the SOC pool in the project scenario mus t be estimated using Module 
M-PEAT  or M-TW  (whichever is relevant). For p eat strata within  tidal wetlands , Module M-PEAT  
must be used. 
Stand-alone CIW and CIW-REDD proj ect activities must use Module  M-TW  or M-PEAT  
(whichever is relevant) for the estimation of project net emiss ions from the SOC pool, and 
Module M-REDD  for all other pools and emissions (where relevant). 
Stand-alone RWE and RWE-ARR project activities must use Module M-PEAT  or M-TW  
(whichever is relevant) for pr oject net GHG emissions from the SOC pool. Where fossil fuel 
combustion is accounted for, Module E-FFC  must be used as well. RWE-ARR project activities 
must also use Module M-ARR  for the accounting of biomass and biomass burning (where 
relevant). RWE-REDD project a ctivities must use Module M-PEAT  or M-TW  (whichever is 
relevant) for the estimation o f project net emissions from the SOC pool, and Module M-REDD  for 
all other pools and emissions. 
8.3 Leakage 
Leakage must be considered for all activities, using the follow ing leakage modules: 
 For planned deforestation/degradation and planned wetland degr adation: Module LK-
ASP  
 For unplanned deforestation and unplanned wetland degradation:  Module LK-ASU   
 For fuel-wood/charcoal collection: Module LK-DFW  
 For pre-project agricultural or aquacultural activities: Modul e LK-ARR  
 For WRC project activities: Module LK-ECO    VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 32 For stand-alone CIW project act ivities, similar methods for lea kage determination can be used 
as for REDD project activities, and Module LK-ASU , LK-ASP or LK-ME  (whichever is relevant) 
must be used. 
Combined RWE-ARR projects must use Module LK-ASP . 
The significance of leakage and  the significance of carbon pool s may be determined using T-SIG . 
Where applicable, leakage due to market effects must be conside red using Module LK-ME . 
Market effects must be consider ed where the project leads to a decrease in the production of 
timber, fuelwood, or charcoal. 
Where, pre-project, unsustainable fuelwood collection is occurr ing within the project boundary, 
Modules BL-DFW and LK-DFW  must be used to determine potential leakage. 
Where leakage prevention activ ities include tree planting, aqua cultural intensification, agricultural 
intensification, fertilization , fodder producti on, other measur es to enhance cropland and/or 
grazing land areas, leakage management zones or a combination o f these, then any significant 
increase in GHG emissions associ ated with these activities must  be accounted for, unless 
deemed de minimis , as determined using T-SIG . 
Leakage prevention activities may lead to the increase in combu stion of fossil fuels; however, any 
increase in emissions is  considered insignificant. 
Where leakage prevention leads to a significant increase in the  use of fertilizers, Module E-NA  
must be used. T-SIG  can be used to determine significance. 
As per the applicability conditi ons, leakage prev ention may not  include the flooding of agricultural 
lands (e.g., for new rice paddies) nor the creation of livestoc k feedlots and/or manure lagoons. 
Leakage prevention may also not include the drainage of peatlan d. 
The list of leakage sources with appropriate justification must  be presented. 
Positive leakage may not be accounted for.

8.4.5 Calculation of AFOLU Pooled Buffer Account Contribution 
The number of credits to be held in the AFOLU pooled buffer acc ount is determined as a 
percentage of the total carbon st ock benefits. For REDD project  activities, this is equal to the net 
emissions in the baseline minus emissions from fossil fuel use and fertilizer use minus the net 
emissions in the project case mi nus emissions from fossil fuels  and fertilizer use. Leakage 
emissions do not factor into  the buffer calculations. 
For REDD projects, the calculat ion of the net change in carbon stocks applied in this 
methodology includes an adjustme nt for emissions from fossil fu el combustion and direct N 2O 
emissions and excludes emissions from biomass burning. Besides other GHG fluxes, biomass 
burning involves a carbon stock change. The procedure, therefor e, provides a conservative 
(larger) estimate of the buffer withholding. 
For WRC project activities, the proxy for the net change in car bon stocks applied in this 
methodology is NER WRC. As this proxy includes all net G HG emissions reductions, it p rovides a 
conservative (larger) estimate of the buffer. 
Since GHG emission reductions fr om ARR are unlikely to differ g reatly from the net change in 
carbon stocks, the proxy for t he net change in carbon stocks ap plied in this methodology is 
NGR ARR. As this proxy includes all GHG emissions reductions and remov als, it provides a 
conservative (larger) estima te of the buffer withholding.

Project must use Module X-UNC  to combine uncertainty informat ion and conservative estimates 
and produce an overall uncertainty  estimate of the total net GH G emission reductions. The 
estimated cumulative net anthro pogenic GHG emission reductions must be adjusted at each 
point in time to account for uncer tainty as indicated in Module  X-UNC25. Module X-UNC  
calculates an adjusted value for NER REDD+  for any point in time. This adjusted Adjusted_NER REDD+  
must be the basis of calculations at each point in time in Equa tion 19.  
8.4.7 Calculation of Verified Carbon Units 
To estimate the number of Verif ied Carbon Units (VCUs) for the monitoring period T = t2-t1 , this 
methodology uses the following equation: 
    VCUtAdjusted _NERREDD,t2Adjusted _NERREDD,t1  BufferTotal (19) 
Where: 
VCU t  Number of Verified Carbon Units at year t = t 2 - t1 (VCU)

year t2 and adjusted to accoun t for uncertainty (t CO 2e) 
Adjusted_NER REDD+,t1   Total net GHG emission reductions of the REDD+ project activi ty up to 
year t1 and adjusted to accoun t for uncertainty (t CO 2e) 
                                                            
24 Buffer withholding percentages  are based on the project’s over all risk classification, t he percentage of carbon 
credits generated by the approved project activity that must be  deposited into t he AFOLU pooled bu ffer account to 
cover non-permanence related project risks. Buffer withholding percentage must be calculated using T-BAR . 
Different percentages will likely  be calculated for each of the  baseline types as relevant.  
25 The allowable uncertainty under this methodology is +/- 15% of  NER REDD+  at the 95% confidence level. Where this 
precision level is met then no deduction should result for unce rtainty. Where uncertainty exceeds 15% of NER REDD+  
at the 95% confidence level then the deduction must be equal to  the amount that the uncertainty exceeds the 
allowable level.

9.3 Description of the Monitoring Plan 
9.3.1 Development of Monitoring Plan 
General 
The monitoring plan must address the following monitoring tasks , which must be included in the 
monitoring plan: 
 Monitoring of project implementation 
 Monitoring of actual carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas e missions 
 Monitoring of leakage carbon sto ck changes and greenhouse gas emissions 
 Estimation of ex post  net carbon stock changes a nd greenhouse gas emissions 
For each of these tasks, the moni toring plan must include the f ollowing information: 
a. Technical description of the monitoring task  b. Data to be collected (the list of data and parameters to be collected must be given in PD) 
c. Overview of data co llection procedures 
d. Quality control and qualit y assurance procedure  
e. Data archiving f. Organisation and re sponsibilities of the parties involved in  all of the above 
Uncertainty and Quality Management 
Quality management procedures are required for the management o f data and information, 
including the assessment of unc ertainty, relevant to the projec t and baseline scenarios. As far as 
is practical, uncertainties rel ated to the quantification of GH G emission reductions and removals 
by sinks should be reduced. 
To help reduce uncertainties i n the accounting of emissions and  removals, this methodology 
uses, whenever possible, the pr oven methods from the latest ava ilable IPCC guidance 
documents (GPG-LULUCF and Reporti ng Guidelines) and peer-review ed literature. Despite this, 
potential uncertaintie s still arise from the choice of paramete rs to be used. Uncertainties arising 
from input parameters would result in uncertainties in the esti mation of both baseline net GHG 
emissions and project net GHG emissions – especially when globa l default factors are used. The 
project must identify key paramet ers that would significantly i nfluence the accuracy of estimates. 
Local values that are specific  to the project circumstances mus t then be obtained for these key 
parameters, whenever possible. T hese values should be based on:  VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 49  Data from well-referenced peer-r eviewed literature or other we ll-established published 
sources26; or 
 National inventory data or def ault factors from IPCC literatur e that has, whenever 
possible and necessary, been check ed for consistency against av ailable local data 
specific to the project circumstances; or 
 In the absence of the above sour ces of information, expert opi nion may be used to assist 
with data selection. Experts will often provide a range of data , as well as a most probable 
value for the data. The rationale  for selecting a particular da ta value must be briefly 
noted. 
In choosing key parameters, or making important assumptions bas ed on information that is not 
specific to the project circumsta nces, such as in use of defaul t factors, the project must select 
values that will lead to an accura te estimation of net GHG emis sion reductions, taking into 
account uncertainties. 
If uncertainty is significant, t he project must choose data suc h that it indisputably tends to under-
estimate, rather than over-estim ate, net GHG project benefits. 
To ensure that GHG fluxes are e stimated in a way that is accura te, verifiable, transparent, and 
consistent across measurement periods, the project must establi sh and document clear standard 
operating procedures and procedu res for ensuring data quality. At a minimum, these procedures 
must include: 
 Comprehensive documentation o f all field measurements carried out in the project area. 
This document must be detailed enough to allow replication of s ampling in the event of 
staff turnover between monitoring periods 
 Training procedures for all perso ns involved in field measurem ent or data analysis. The 
scope and date of all training must be documented 
 A protocol for assessing the ac curacy of plot measurements usi ng a check cruise and a 
plan for correcting the invent ory if errors are discovered 
 Protocols for assessing data for outliers, transcription error s, and consistency across 
measurement periods 
 Data sheets must be safely arc hived for the life of the projec t. Data stored in electronic 
formats must be backed up 
Expert judgement 
The use of expert judgment for t he selection and interpretation  of methods, selection of input data 
to fill gaps in available data, and selection of data from a ra nge of possible values or uncertainty 
                                                            
26 Typically, citations for source s of data used should include: the report or paper title, p ublisher, page numbers, 
publication date etc. (or a det ailed web address). If web-based  reports are cited, hardcop ies should be included as 
annexes in the PD if there is any likelihood that such reports may not be permanently available.  VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 50 ranges, are all well established in the IPCC 2006 good practice  guidance. Obtaining well-
informed judgments from domain experts regarding best estimates  and uncertainties is an 
important aspect in various proc edures througho ut this methodol ogy. The project proponent must 
use the guidance provided in Cha pter 2 (Approaches to Data Coll ection), in particular, Section 2.2 
and Annex 2A.1 of the  IPCC 2006 good pra ctice guidance. 
Monitoring of Project Implementation 
Information must be provided, and recorded, to establish that: 
1) The geographic position of t he project boundary is recorded for all areas of land. The 
geographic coordinates of the proj ect boundary (an d any stratif ication or buffer zones 
inside the boundary) are establis hed, recorded and archived. Th is can be achieved by 
field survey (eg, using GPS), or by using georeferenced spatial  data (eg, maps, GIS 
datasets, orthorectified aeri al photography o r georeferenced re mote sensing images). 
The above also applies to the recording of strata, including st rata resulting from peatland 
fires in the project scenario. 
2) Commonly accepted principles of land use inventory and manag ement are implemented. 
 Standard operating procedures (SO Ps) and quality control/quali ty assurance 
(QA/QC) procedures for inventories including field data collect ion and data 
management must be applied. Use o r adaptation of SOPs already a pplied in national 
land use monitoring, or available from published handbooks, or from the latest IPCC 
guidance documents (GPG–LULUCF , Reporting Guidelines, is recomm ended 
 Apply SOPs, especially for actions likely to cause peat distur bances 
 The project plan, together with a record of the plan as actual ly implemented during 
the project must be available for validation or verification, a s appropriate 
For WRC project activities, c ontinued compliance with the appli cability conditions of this 
methodology must be ensur ed by monitoring that: 
 The water table is not lowered except where the project conver ts open water to tidal 
wetlands, or improves the hydrological connection to impounded waters 
 The burning of organic soil as a project activity does not occ ur 
 Peatland fires within the projec t area do not occur in the pro ject scenario. If they do 
occur as non-catastrophic event s, they are accounted for by can celling the Fire 
Reduction Premium for the entire project or the individual proj ect activity instance. 
 Nitrogen fertilizers are not used within the project area in t he project scenario VM0007, Version 1.6

For monitoring changes in forest cover and carbon stock changes , the monitoring plan must use 
the methods given in Module M-REDD . All relevant parameters from the modules are to be 
included in the monitoring plan.  
ARR 
For monitoring carbon stock ch anges, the monitoring plan must u se the methods given in module 
M-ARR . All relevant parameters from the modules are to be included i n the monitoring plan. 
WRC 
For monitoring GHG emissions from peatland or tidal wetlands, t he monitoring plan must use the 
methods given in Module M-PEAT  or M-TW , respectively. All relev ant parameters from the 
modules are to be included as the SOC pool in the monitoring pl an.  
9.3.2 Monitoring 
Ex-post  monitoring must have two key aspects: 
TASK 1. Monitoring according to monitoring plan TASK 2. Revising the baseline fo r future project crediting peri ods  
TASK 1: Monitoring According to the Monitoring Plan Monitoring of Key Baseline Variables 
REDD 
Information required to periodi cally reassess the project basel ine must be collected during the 
entire project crediting period. K ey variables to be measured a re: 
 Changes in forest cover in the Re ference Regions for Deforesta tion (RRD) (at a minimum 
of every 10 years), as specified in Module M-REDD  and where relevant in Module BL-
UP. 
 Spatial variable datasets used  to model the location of defore station, as specified in 
Module BL-UP . As a minimum, the variables us ed in the first baseline assess ment must 
be monitored at the time of the re-assessment to determine if t hey have changed. 
 Where required, carbon stock data, as specified in Module M-REDD . 
   VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 52 ARR 
Changes in biomass carbon stocks  in the project area must be me asured before each verification 
as part of the monitoring. Methods must be consistent with the methodology given in Module M-
ARR  and any technical guidance specified in the monitoring plan. 
WRC 
In projects with a WRC componen t, the information required to p eriodically reassess the project 
baseline must include changes in  the drainage layout and climat e variables, as specified in 
Module BL-PEAT  or BL-TW  and, where relevant, Modules BL-UP and BL-PL and any technical 
guidance specified in the monitoring plan. 
Carbon stocks in most cases will not have to be monitored durin g the baseline period, except in 
the following cases: 
 Where there is an increased accuracy and precision of the ex-ante  carbon stock 
estimates, which are also used for ex-post  calculations. Verifiable evidence must be 
provided to VCS verifiers that t he accuracy and precision of th e carbon stock estimates 
have improved, compared to previ ous estimates. Any change in ca rbon stock densities 
will be subject to validation. 
 Where emissions reductions/remov als are claimed for avoiding f orest degradation 
caused by extraction of wood for fuel or charcoal or carbon seq uestration in forest land 
that would have been deforested in  the baseline case. In such c ases, the methods 
described in Module M-REDD .  
Carbon stocks must be reassessed at every baseline revision. Where emissions are included in  the baseline, t hey must be moni tored in the project case, 
following the methodological proc edures described in the emissi on modules ( E-BPB , E-FFC , and 
E-NA ).  
The calculations of actual carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions must be 
reported using transparent procedures. 
Changes in water depths in the project area (and leakage belt f or unplanned deforestation), must 
be measured before each verificat ion as part of the monitoring.  Methods must be consistent with 
the methodology given in Module M-PEAT  or M-TW  and any technical guidance specified in the 
monitoring plan.
 
Monitoring of Leakage 
All significant sources of leakage identified are subject to mo nitoring, following the procedures 
outlined in the monitoring plan. S uch procedures must be consis tent with the applicable leakage VM0007, Version 1.6 
Sectoral Scope 14 
 
REDD+MF - 53 modules ( LK-ASP , LK-ASU , LK-ME , LK-DFW , LK-ARR  and LK-ECO ). All relevant parameters in 
the leakage modules must be incl uded in the monitoring plan. 
TASK 2: Revising the Baseline for Future Project Crediting Peri ods 
Baselines must be revised over ti me because agents, drivers and  underlying causes of 
deforestation as well as drai nage layouts and climate variables  change dynamically. The 
methodological procedure used to  update the baseline must be th e same as used in the first 
estimation.

REDD+MF - 54 DOCUMENT HISTORY 
Version Date Comment 
v1.0 3 Dec 2010 Initial version  
v1.1 7 Sept 2011 The REDD Methodol ogy Framework was updated to limit the 
reassessment of the unplanned baseline scenario to every ten ye ars. 
The methodology was also incremen ted to reflect a revision to t he 
module for estimation of base line carbon stock changes and 
greenhouse gas emission from unplanned deforestation (BL-UP), v 2.0, 
which was approved under the VC S Program on 7 September 2011. 
v1.2 31 July 2012 Table 2 was removed to avoid confusion with T able 1. Table 1 is now 
the exclusive source in t he methodology for determining 
included/excluded pools. 
v1.3 20 Nov 2012 The REDD Met hodology Framework was updated to include avoided 
planned degradation as an allowable activity: 
 Removed the applicability conditi on “where post- deforestation 
land use constitutes reforestation this module must not be 
used” 
 Renamed “planned deforestation”  to “planned deforestation and 
planned degradation” 
 Added the text “hereafter in this  module, “deforestation” refe rs 
to both deforestation a nd planned degradation” 
A correction made to equation 8  to appropriately calculate the total 
VCUs available for issuance. 
v1.4 3 May 2013 Applicability condition for unplanned deforesta tion “where post-
deforestation land use constitutes reforestation this module mu st not be 
used” was removed. 
Equations 4, 5 and 6 were revised  to appropriate ly account for the 
buffer. 
v1.5 9 March 2015 Upda ted to include REDD+ p roject activities o n peatlands, as well as 
activities that include ARR. 
Methodology now includes six new modules: VMD0041 BL-ARR , 
VMD0042 BL-PEAT , VMD0043 LK-ARR , VMD0044 LK-ECO , VMD0045 
M-ARR , and VMD0046 M-PEAT . 
v1.6 8 Sep 2020 Updated to include  CIW and RWE project activiti es on tidal wetlands.
